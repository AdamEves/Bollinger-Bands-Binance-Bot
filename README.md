## Introduction

The Bollinger Bands Trading Bot uses historical price data to calculate Bollinger Bands, which consist of an upper band, a middle band (simple moving average), and a lower band. The strategy is based on the principle that prices tend to stay within the bands. When the price crosses above the upper band, it may be an indication to sell. Conversely, when the price crosses below the lower band, it may be an indication to buy.

This tool leverages the Binance API to access real-time market data and execute trades on the Binance exchange. It provides a Flask server to expose endpoints for fetching Bollinger Bands data and placing trades.
